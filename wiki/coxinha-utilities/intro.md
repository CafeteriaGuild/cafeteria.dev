Coxinha Utilities is an utility mod adding mostly random and unoriginal things (Check the [Attribution](./attribution) page!)

## Getting started

Being an utility mod, there's no progression. Just craft whatever fits your needs!

:::warning
Prior to version `1.4.7+1.19.4`, Coxinha Utilities was an addon for [Kibe Utilities](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/kibe), being required on such versions. 

Even if you're on later versions, Kibe Utilities is recommended for extended crafting recipes.
