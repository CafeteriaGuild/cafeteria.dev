## Blacklist

Any block on the blacklist cannot be packed. There's 2 ways to add blocks to the blacklist:

- Adding blocks to the `coxinhautilities:unboxable` tag;
- If [Carrier](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/carrier) is present and `useCarrierBlacklist` is enabled, Carrier's blacklist will also apply.
