# Granny's Sink

*Scientists estimate that all of Earth's oceans combined have a total water volume of ~1,332,000,000 cubic kilometers. That might seem like a lot of water, but it's only a mere fraction of the water contained in Granny's Sink.*

Functions as a single block infinite water source. Its inexplicable infinite amount of water can be pumped at full capacity by pipes.
